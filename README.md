## Welcome to My Page on the Design of various algorithms.

I am maintaining this repository to contain algorithms as I learn to code them. In the course of time, I hope this repository contains the most essential and classic algorithms!

Feel free to connect with me on linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/abishai-ebenezer/ and github!

I will cover the various parts of basic algorithm design like 
1. Brute Force and Exhaustive Search.
2. Decrease and Conquer.
3. Divide and Conquer.
4. Transform and Conquer
5. Space and Time Tradeoffs
6. Dynamic Programming and
7. Greedy techniques. 

I hope you will find this repository useful for your learning!
